# Vertex Color Sample project ( Defold )

![](/docs/screen_vcolor.png)

This sample project shows the use of vertex color imported from glTF file and added to model component. The low poly ball displays vertex colors in its design. Shader vertex program uses the color attribute and in the fragment program varying color is then used to display the colors.

If you run into trouble, help is available in the [Defold forum](https://forum.defold.com).

Happy Defolding!
